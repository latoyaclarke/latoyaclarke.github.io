          <h2 style="color: #fbf59d;">About Me</h2>
          <p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, I taught myself front-end development and design in junior high and high school before going upstate to attend the University at Albany, SUNY. Excelling in the web development and communications courses, I jump-started my digital communications career as a junior in college, honing my skills and work ethic through a series of internships at the university and a government agency. Then, eager to understand <span class="important">what motivates people on the web</span>, I moved back to Brooklyn and worked at nonprofit digital marketing agencies. In various roles, I did content development and optimization for email, paid search, social media, and other content channels.</p>
            <p>After spending years on the web, I shifted my focus to administrative and business operations. I have spent seven years supporting initiatives at a public college, discovering my strengths in internal communications and leaning into my passion for digital communications. Now, with over ten years of combined experience, I use a strategic lens and technical savvy to <span class="important">create and develop what people want to see</span>.</p>
